Use an interactive truth table to write a logical expression in a programming language of your choice.

### Problems

- The interface does not look very nice. While I could upgrade it with some css, this project is about utility and functionality.
- The click handlers to change the outputs do not always update. Not sure why this happens. I have added a button to fix that.
- Refilling the table sometimes overwrites outputs.
- The algorithm is not very smart. This can be improved with some time.
